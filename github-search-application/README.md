# GitHub Search Application

This mobile application was created by following this tutorial from [Gone Hybrid](https://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2).

It asks the user to search for a GitHub username and then displays all of the repositories that they have. Upon clicking on one of the repositories the user is taken to the corresponding README
