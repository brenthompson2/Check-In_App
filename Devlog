Devlog
Brendan Thompson

Description:
	Now Basically a log of Awesome Check In App Development DevLog
	Was a log of activities as I learned to develop mobile applications using Ionic

Current Status 09/29/17:

	1) Asks the user what brought them in (Entrepreneurship, Learning to Code, or The Workspace)
		- if entrepreneurship, asks which program they are interested in
	2) Asks the user to select the team members who are expecting them
		- option to select "Nobody"
	3) Asks the user for basic info (Name, Email, Reason)
	4) Sends a notification via Slack to the corresponding Awesome Inc team member
	5) Instructs the user to have a seat on one of the couches

	Ideas:
		A) taking the user to some information about the company or the program they are interested in as some light reading material while they wait
		B) implement some sort of idle timer that returns to the home screen after nothing happening for a certain period of time
			- brings up a timed notification that asks the user if they are still there and returns home if no response
		C) Link with productivity statistic software they use

	Thoughts:
		- Should implement TEAMMEMBERS array as a json object instead of manually in both confirm.ts & teamMembers.ts
			- created assets/data/teamMembersArray but failed to import into an array

	Need to Implement:
		*** "I Have an Idea" takes them to the google form to fill out
		- TEAMMEMBERS as separate json file
		- Programs as separate json file
		- Integrate with ZOHO
		- Only displays important people based off selected program
			- Waiting till separate json
		*** Take Pictures also
			- would be fun
			- Ionic should be able to handle this pretty smoothly

Summary:
	- Continued working on the Awesome Inc Check-In App
		- It has been a process but it is starting to come along nice and legit-ly
		- It is in desperate need of graphic design and Sass work
		1) [IMPLEMENTED] The app will ask the user which program they are here for (AwesomeInc, University, Team Alpha, Fellowship)
		2) [IMPLEMENTED] The app will ask the user if they are expected or not
		3) [IN PROGRESS] If expected, they will be asked to select the team members that are expecting them
		4) [IN PROGRESS] The app will ask for information such as name and reason for meeting
		5) [IN PROGRESS] The app will send a notification to the corresponding Awesome Inc team member regarding the arrival of the guest
Thoughts:
	-

Slack API Text Formatting
	- *bold*
	- _italics_
	- This will create\nA two line comment
	- `Code Block`
	- ```If the code is elaborate or contains\nnewline characters
	- There is a slack app to use message buttons

Creating the custom JSON payload for posts to slack
	- chose the icon online in the incoming webhooks management area
	sendSlackMessage() {
		var currentTime = (new Date).getTime() / 1000;
		var formName = this.currentUserInfoFormGroup.get('name').value;
		var formEmail = this.currentUserInfoFormGroup.get('email').value;
		var formReason = this.currentUserInfoFormGroup.get('reason').value;

		var url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/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";
		var messageText = JSON.stringify({
			"username": "Check-In_Bot",
			"text": "A guest has arrived for you!",
			"attachments": [
				{
					"title": formName + " just checked in!",
					"text": "Reason: " + formReason,
					"author_name": formEmail,
					"color": "danger",
					"footer": "Check-In App",
					"ts": currentTime
				}
			]
		})

		return this.ourHttp.post(url, messageText)
			.subscribe();
	}

Added new Home Page

Thoughts:
	- There was a million different versions of http post syntax on the internet and it took way to long to get one to work.

Integrating Slack
	- Manage -> Custom Integrations -> Create Custom WebHook
	- Add Configuration
		- Post to Channel -> #bot-test
		- Webhook URL = https://hooks.slack.com/services/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
		- Sending Messages:
			Option 1 = Send a JSON string as the payload parameter in a POST request
			Option 2 = Send a JSON string as the body of a POST request
		- Customized Appearance:
			- can customize in the Integration Settings section
			- or send: "username": "new-bot-name", "icon_url": "https://slack.com/img/icons/app-57.png", "icon_emoji": ":ghost"
		- Channel Override:
			- "channel": "#other-channel"
			- "channel": "@username"
		- Changed Name to Check-In_Bot
		- Changed Icon to red exclamation point
	- I've tried 100 and a half tutorials and they all say very different things

New Project: Integrating Slack
	ionic start integratingSlack blank
		- gave me the option to create a new app on their website
	ionic cordova add android
	ionc serve --lab
		- its beautiful
	<plug in phone>
	ionic cordova run android
		- giving that error I couldn't fix
		- ANDROID_HOME=/home/bren/Android/Sdk
			JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
			No target specified and no devices found, deploying to emulator

			Error: Cannot read property 'replace' of undefined

			[ERROR] An error occurred while running cordova run android (exit code 1).
	<unplugged phone>

Thoughts:

Creating The Team Members Form
	1) src/app/app.module.ts:
		A) Import Pages & Modules
			import { TeamMembersPage } from '../pages/teamMembers/teamMembers';
			import { UserInfoPage } from '../pages/userInfo/userInfo';

			import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
			import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
			import { BoxCheckedValidator } from '../providers/checkBoxValidators/boxCheckedValidator';
			- I have not yet used the HttpModule in any page
		B) @NgModule({
  				declarations:
  					[MyApp, HomePage, ProgramPage, TeamMembersPage, UserInfoPage],

  				imports:
  					[BrowserModule, HttpModule, FormsModule, IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)],

  				bootstrap:
  					[IonicApp],

  				entryComponents:
  					[MyApp, HomePage, ProgramPage, TeamMembersPage, UserInfoPage],

  				providers:
  					[StatusBar, SplashScreen, {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler}, BoxCheckedValidator]
		})
	2) src/pages/teamMembers/teamMembers.ts:
		A) Imports
			import { NavController, NavParams } from 'ionic-angular';
			import { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';
			import { BoxCheckedValidator } from '../../providers/checkBoxValidators/boxCheckedValidator';
			import { UserInfoPage } from '../userInfo/userInfo';
		B) Member Variables
			public currentProgram;
			public currentMemberFormGroup : FormGroup;
			public TEAMMEMBERS = [
				{id: 1, name:'Emily Wehrle',
					description: 'Director of Operations',
					team: 'main',
					imageURL: 'assets/img/TeamMembers/emilywehrle_wall.gif',
					imageAlt: 'Emily Wehrle'
				},
				{id: 2, name:'Brian Raney',
					description: 'Co-Founder',
					team: 'main',
					imageURL: 'assets/img/TeamMembers/brianraney_wall.gif',
					imageAlt: 'Brian Raney'
				},
				{id: 3, name:'Amanda Murray',
					description: 'Director of Marketing',
					team: 'Marketing',
					imageURL: 'assets/img/TeamMembers/teamMember.png',
					imageAlt: 'Amanda Murray'
				},
				{id: 4, name:'Keith McMunn',
					description: 'Director of Fellowship',
					team: 'Fellowship',
					imageURL: 'assets/img/TeamMembers/teamMember.png',
					imageAlt: 'Keith McMunn'
				},
				{id: 5, name:'Nick Such',
					description: 'Co-Founder',
					team: 'main',
					imageURL: 'assets/img/TeamMembers/nicksuch_wall.gif',
					imageAlt: 'Nick Such'
				},
				{id: 6, name:'Kyle Raney',
					description: 'Development Team',
					team: 'Team Alpha',
					imageURL: 'assets/img/TeamMembers/kyleraney_wall.gif',
					imageAlt: 'Kyle Raney'
				}
			];
		C)  constructor(private navCtrl : NavController,
						private navParameters : NavParams,
						private memberFormBuilder : FormBuilder,
						private memberValidator : BoxCheckedValidator) {

				this.currentProgram = this.navParameters.get('currentProgram');

				this.currentMemberFormGroup = this.memberFormBuilder.group ({
					teamMembers: this.memberFormBuilder.group({
						1	: [false],
						2	: [false],
						3	: [false],
						4	: [false],
						5	: [false],
						6	: [false]
					}, { validator: this.memberValidator.validateABoxChecked })
				});
			}
		D)  submitTeamMembers() {
				this.navCtrl.push(UserInfoPage, { currentProgram: this.currentProgram,
												memberFormGroup: this.currentMemberFormGroup });
			}
	3) Create the form interface
		<form [formGroup]="currentMemberFormGroup" (ngSubmit)="outputValidator(currentMemberFormGroup.value)">
			<ion-item-group formGroupName="teamMembers">
				<ion-card *ngFor="let member of TEAMMEMBERS">
					<ion-card-header>
						<ion-item>
							<ion-label>{{ member.name }}</ion-label>
							<ion-checkbox color="red" formControlName="{{ member.id }}"></ion-checkbox>
						</ion-item>
					</ion-card-header>
					<ion-card-content>
						{{ member.description }}
						<img src="{{ member.imageURL }}" alt="{{ member.imageAlt }}">
					</ion-card-content>
				</ion-card>
			</ion-item-group>

			<button ion-button block [disabled]="!currentMemberFormGroup.valid" (click)="submitTeamMembers()">Submit</button>
		</form>
	4) Create the BoxCheckedValidator to ensure that one of the members was selected
		A) Imports
			import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
			import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';
		B)
			validateABoxChecked(boxes: FormControl){
				var isValid 	: boolean = false,
					index		: any;

				for (index in boxes.value){
					var val = boxes.value[index];

					if (val) {
						isValid = true;
						break;
					}
				}

				if (isValid) {
					return null;
				}

				return {
					checkboxRequired: true
				};
			}

Summary:
	- Continued working on the Awesome Inc Check-In App
		- It has been a process but it is starting to come along nice and legit-ly
		- It is in desperate need of graphic design and Sass work
		1) [IMPLEMENTED] The app will ask the user which program they are here for (AwesomeInc, University, Team Alpha, Fellowship)
		2) [IMPLEMENTED] The app will ask the user if they are expected or not
		3) [IN PROGRESS] If expected, they will be asked to select the team members that are expecting them
	- Got debugging to work on my LGv20 phone
		- Settings > General > About Phone > Software info > *click on "Build Number" 7 times*
		- Plugged it in and ran in the computer terminal "ionic cordova run android"
			- Automatically installed the app onto my phone
	- Fixed images: img src path is relative to /src/index.html, so assets/img/photo.jpg
	- Added more Programs, logos, and better descriptions
	- Researched changing app logo & name but both require internet access
	- ionic serve --lab -lc
		- lc adds console output log
	- Not sure that the FormGroup and FormBuilder are working properly
Thoughts:
	- Excited that I can emulate iOS and Android using "ionic serve --lab"
		- Still gonna need to find out how to port it to an actual iOS device
	- It is really annoying that I can't use "ionic serve --lab" at my internet-less job because I need "an external network interface"
		- will be fixed for 3.10.0 - https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/issues/2690


Adding Team Member select to the Awesome Inc Check-In App
	I) In program.html prompt the user to choose whether or not they are expected
		<ion-card (click)="isExpected(this.currentProgram)">
			<ion-card-header>
				Somebody is expecting me!
			</ion-card-header>
		</ion-card>
		<ion-card (click)="notExpected(this.currentProgram)">
			<ion-card-header>
				I am interested in meeting with somebody!
			</ion-card-header>
		</ion-card>
	II) in program.ts create functions to take the user to the appropriate page
		isExpected(program) { this.navCtrl.push(teamMembers, { currentProgram: program }); }
		notExpected(program) { this.navCtrl.push(ProgramPage, { currentProgram: program }); }
	III) Create teamMembers.html as a checkbox of team members
		<h1 text-center>Please select the team members that are expecting you</h1>

		<ion-card *ngFor="let member of TEAMMEMBERS">
			<ion-card-header>
				<ion-item>
					<ion-label>{{ member.name }}</ion-label>
					<ion-checkbox color="red" checked="false"></ion-scheckbox>
				</ion-item>
			</ion-card-header>
			<ion-card-content>
				{{ member.description }}
				<img src="{{ member.imageURL }}" alt="{{ member.imageAlt }}">
			</ion-card-content>
		</ion-card>

		<button ion-button block (click)="submitTeamMembers(this.currentProgram)">Submit</button>
	IV) Create teamMembers.ts to manage submitting the checkBox

	V) Create a form of checkboxes (see below section following the article by masteringionic.com)

	) import TeamMembersPage in program.ts
		import { TeamMembersPage } from '../teamMembers/teamMembers';
	) Add the new pages & providers to src/app/app.module.ts
		import { TeamMembersPage } from '../pages/teamMembers/teamMembers';
		import { TeamMembersValidator } from '../providers/teamMemberValidator/teamMemberValidator';
		@NgModule({
			declarations: [
			    MyApp,
			    HomePage,
			    ProgramPage,
			    TeamMembersPage
			],
			...
			bootstrap: [IonicApp],
			entryComponents: [
			    MyApp,
			    HomePage,
			    ProgramPage,
			    TeamMembersPage
			],

Adding a new app icon
	- add image as icon.png to src/resources/
	- run: ionic cordova resources
		- need to log into an Ionic account?

Changing app name
	- change <name>MyApp</name> to <name>Awesome Check-In</name> in config.xml
	- remove and re-add android platform so as to overwrite the AndroidManifest.xml
		ionic cordova platform rm android
		ionic cordova platform add android
	- didn't do because no internet

Creating a form of checkboxes:
	- masteringionic.com/blog/2017-01-28-validating-multiple-checkboxes-with-ionic
	1) Create a a teamMemberValidator provider src/providers/teamMemberValidator/teamMemberValidator.ts
		"
		import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
		import { FormControl } from '@angular/forms';
		import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
		import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';

		/*
		  Provider for validating the checkboxes in the teamMembersPage
		*/

		@Injectable()
		export class TeamMemberValidator {

			constructor(private http: HttpModule) {
			}

			validateCheckboxes(boxes: FormControl){
				var valid 	: boolean = false,
					k		: any;

				for (k in boxes.value){
					var val = boxes.value[k];

					if (val) {
						valid = true;
						break;
					}
				}

				if (valid) {
					return null;
				}

				return {
					checkboxRequired: true
				};
			}
		}
		"
		- validateCheckboxes method
		- FormControl is injected as a dependency allowing the method to receive an abstract representation of the form input field that the FormControl is mapped to.
		- loops through all of the FormControls and returns null to signal if the validation successfully passed
		- validation fails if function returns checkboxRequired w/ a value of true
		- I don't think it uses the HttpModule import
	2) Update teamMembers.ts
		A) new imports
			import { FormBuilder, FormGroup, Validators } from '@angular/forms';
			import { TeamMemberValidator } from '../../providers/teamMemberValidator/teamMemberValidator';
		B) more member variables
			public form : FormGroup;
		C) more constructor parameters
			private cbForm: FormBuilder,
			private cbvalidator: TeamMemberValidator
		D) create a FormBuilder object in the constructor
			this.form = cbForm.group({
				'teamMembers': cbForm.group({
					1	: [false],
					2	: [false],
					3	: [false],
					4	: [false],
					5	: [false],
					6	: [false]
				}, { validator: cbvalidator.validateCheckboxes })
			});
			- FormGroup assigned an index titled service of FormControl objects
			- initial default values of false for each FormControl
			- supply the validateCheckboxes method from our cbValidator service
		E) Create the validation outputter
			outputValidator(val){
				console.log('Validating Form');
				console.dir(val);
			}
	3) Create the UI
		<form [formGroup]="form" (ngSubmit)="outputValidator(form.value)">
			-
		<ion-item-group formGroupName="teamMembers">
			- collect and organize checkboxes
		<ion-checkbox color="danger" formControlName="{{ member.id }}"></ion-checkbox>
			- checkboxes have formConrolName attributes
		<button [disabled]="!form.valid"></button>
	4) Add providers to app.module.ts:
		import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
		import { TeamMemberValidator } from '../providers/teamMemberValidator/teamMemberValidator';
		...
		imports: [
			...
    		HttpModule,
    		...
    	...
    	providers: [
    		TeamMemberValidator
    	...
    	- I don't think I am even using the HttpModule stuff

Summary:
	- Updated GitHub application to display the README upon clicking a repository
	- Started working on the Awesome Inc Check-In App
		- It has been a process but it is starting to come along nice and legit-ly
		- It is in desperate need of graphic design and Sass work
		1) [COMPLETE] The app will ask the user which program they are here for (AwesomeInc, University, Team Alpha, Fellowship)
		2) The app will ask the user for some basic information: name, if they are expected, who they are here to see, reason, etc.
		3) The app will send a notification to the corresponding Awesome Inc team member regarding the arrival of the guest and instruct the user to have a seat on one of the couches
		4) Bonus: Just got the idea of then taking the user to some information about the company or the program they are interested in as some light reading material while they wait
Thoughts:
	- Excited that I can emulate iOS and Android using "ionic serve --lab"
		- Still gonna need to find out how to port it to an actual iOS device
	- It is really annoying that I can't use "ionic serve --lab" at my internet-less job because I need "an external network interface"
		- will be fixed for 3.10.0
		- https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli/issues/2690

Continuing https://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2
	- Part 6 - Navigating between Pages (this post)
		1) Prepare home.html & home.ts
			A) Adding click handler to home.html
				<ion-card *ngFor="let repo of foundRepos" (click)="goToDetails(repo)">
			B) import NavController & DetailsPage (even though we haven't made it yet) to home.ts
				import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular';
				import {DetailsPage} from '../details/details';
			C) Inject the NavController into the constructor
				constructor(private github: GitHubProvider, private nav: NavController) {}
			D) Create a goToDetails(repo) function
				goToDetails(repo) {	this.nav.push(DetailsPage, { repo: repo }); }
			- Overview:
				- NavController already has home page loaded
				- upon click of a card, it pushes DetailsPage onto the navigation stack and the framework loads the page / handles the native transition
				- Won't need to explicitly pop if DetailsPage has an <ion-navbar> because it will automatically add a back button
		2) Add new GitHubProvider
			import {Http, Headers} from '@angular/http';
			getDetails(repo) {
				let headers = new Headers();
				headers.append('accept', 'application/vnd.github.VERSION.html');
				return this.http.get(`${repo.url}/readme`, { headers: headers });
			}
			- Overview:
				- import Headers
				- gets contents of the repo README
				- 'accept' specifies that we want it in HTML format
		3) Create the DetailsPage
			A) new folder src/pages/details/
			B) Write details.html:
				"
				<ion-header>
				  <ion-navbar>
				    <ion-title>
				     	{{ repo.name }}
				    </ion-title>
				  </ion-navbar>
				</ion-header>

				<ion-content>
					<div padding [innerHTML]="readme"></div>
				</ion-content>
				"
				- <div padding>{{ readme }}</div> wouldn't work because it would encode the HTML and would display the actual code
			C) Write details.ts
				import { NavController, NavParams } from 'ionic-angular';
				- members:
					public readme = '';
					public repo;
				"
				constructor(private github: GitHubProvider,
							private nav: NavController,
							private navParams: NavParams) {

					this.repo = navParams.get('repo');

					this.github.getDetails(this.repo).subscribe(
						data => this.readme = data.text(),
						err => {
							if (err.status == 404) {
								this.readme = 'This repo does not have a README';
							} else {
								console.error(err);
							}
						},
						() => console.log('getDetails completed')
					)
				}"
				- Overview:
					- import NavParams
						- used to get repo sent by HomePage
					- inject navParams to the constructor:
		4) Add DetailsPage to app.module.ts
			"
			import { DetailsPage } from '../pages/details/details'
			...
			declarations: [
			    MyApp,
			    HomePage,
			    DetailsPage
			],
			...
			bootstrap: [IonicApp],
			entryComponents: [
			    MyApp,
			    HomePage,
			    DetailsPage
			]
			"
	- That is the end of the tutorial except for some more emulation/testing information

- Beginning the AwesomeInc Check-In App
	- As part of my AwesomeInc Internship they have asked me to develop a mobile app to keep running on an iPad by the entrance for guests to use to check in.
		1) The app will ask the user which program they are here for (AwesomeInc, University, Team Alpha, Fellowship)
		2) The app will ask the user for some basic information: name, if they are expected, who they are here to see, reason, etc.
		3) The app will send a notification to the corresponding Awesome Inc team member regarding the arrival of the guest and instruct the user to have a seat on one of the couches
		4) Bonus: Just got the idea of then taking the user to some information about the company or the program they are interested in as some light reading material while they wait
	ionic start AInc_CheckIn_App blank
		- create new project called AInc_Ch...
	ionic cordova platform add android
	ionic cordova platform add ios
	ionic serve --lab
		- run both platforms in a browser
	ionic cordova run android
		- run on the android emulator
	I) Create the Homepage:
		A) create the HomePage template src/pages/home/home.html:
			"
			<ion-header>
		  	  <ion-navbar>
			    <ion-title>
			      Welcome to Awesome Inc!
			    </ion-title>
			  </ion-navbar>
			</ion-header>

			<ion-content padding>
				<h1 text-center>Which program are you here for?</h1>

				<ion-card *ngFor="let program of PROGRAMS" (click)="goToProgram(program)">
					<ion-card-header>
						{{ program.name }}
					</ion-card-header>
					<ion-card-content>
						{{ program.description }}
						<img src="{{ program.imageURL }}" alt="{{ program.imageAlt }}">
					</ion-card-content>
				</ion-card>
			</ion-content>
			"
			- Using Angular *ngFor & JSON {{templates}} to cycle through the list of PROGRAMS
				- PROGRAMS currently defined in html.ts
			- Images still not working
		B) create the HomePage TypeScript Component src/pages/home/home.ts
			1) include NavController & ProgramPage
				import { NavController } from 'ionic-angular';
				import { ProgramPage } from '../programs/program';
			2) Define PROGRAMS
				PROGRAMS = [
					{id: 1, name:'Awesome Inc',
						description: 'The Main Entrepenuarial Epicenter',
						imageURL: '../../assets/img/logo.png',
						imageAlt: 'Awesome Inc Logo'
					},
					{id: 2, name:'Awesome Inc University',
						description: 'The Bootcamps and Classes for both youth and adults',
						imageURL: '../../assets/img/Awesome Inc U - Logo_header.png',
						imageAlt: 'Awesome Inc U Logo'
					},
					{id: 3, name:'Awesome Inc Fellowship',
						description: 'The incubator programs for start-ups',
						imageURL: '../../assets/img/fellowship_logo.png',
						imageAlt: 'Fellowship Logo'
					},
					{id: 4, name:'Awesome Inc Team Alpha',
						description: 'The Interns that make Awesome Inc possible',
						imageURL: '../../assets/img/teamalpha.png',
						imageAlt: 'Team Alpha Logo'
					}
				];
			3) Include the NavController in the constructor:
				constructor(public navCtrl: NavController) {}
			4) create the goToProgram() fn
				goToProgram(program) {
					this.navCtrl.push(ProgramPage, { currentProgram: program });
				}
	II) Create the program page
		A) New folder src/pages/programs
		B) Create the program template src/pages/programs/program.html
		 	"
		 	<ion-header>
			  <ion-navbar>
			    <ion-title>
			     	{{ this.currentProgram.name }}
			    </ion-title>
			  </ion-navbar>
			</ion-header>

			<ion-content>
				<div padding>
					<img src="{{ this.currentProgram.imageURL }}" alt="{{ this.currentProgram.imageAlt }}">
			     	<p>{{ this.currentProgram.description }}</p>
				</div>
			</ion-content>
			"
		C) Create the program TypeScript Component src/pages/programs/program.ts
			"
				import { Component } from '@angular/core';
				import { NavController, NavParams } from 'ionic-angular';

				@Component({
					selector: 'page-program',
					templateUrl: 'program.html',
				})

				export class ProgramPage {
					public currentProgram;

					constructor(private navCtrl: NavController,
								private navParameters: NavParams) {

						this.currentProgram = this.navParameters.get('currentProgram');
					}

				}

			"
			- import NavParams along with NavController
			- create currentProgram public member
			- in the constructor set currentProgram to the program passed using NavParams
	III) Update the Application Information
		A) Add program page to src/app/app.module.ts
			1) import the ProgramPage component
				import { ProgramPage } from '../pages/programs/program';
			2) add ProgramPage to declarations & entryComponents
				"
				declarations: [
				    MyApp,
				    HomePage,
				    ProgramPage
				],
				...
				bootstrap: [IonicApp],
				entryComponents: [
				    MyApp,
				    HomePage,
				    ProgramPage
				],
				"
	IV) Upload pictures to src/assets/img/

Summary:
	- Created a GitHub Search app
Thoughts:
	- Annoyed with the difficulty I am having trying to learn as a result of the amount of abstraction and amount of different yet powerful tools all working together
	- I feel like I am using so many things that are popular but I don't even realize it.
		- Ionic, Angular 2, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5), JSON, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Node.js, PHP?, ???)

- Following a Tutorial:
	- https://scoth.io/tutorials/create-your-first-mobile-app-with-angularjs-and-ionic
		I) What Really is Ionic?
			- front-end SDK for building cross-platform movile apps. Built on top of Angular, ionic also provides a platform for integrating services like push notifications and analytics.
			- UI library to make a better Cordova project
			- Like Bootstrap or Foundation but for mobile instead of web
			- "I will also explain how to build mobile apps with Phonegap app so we won't have to bother with Platform SDKs"
		II) Creating a Project
			ionic start {appname} {template}
				- can also be a github URL to a custom template
			ionic cordova platform add ios
			ionic cordova platform add android
			ionic serve --lab -> emulates it on the web and lab to preview better as mobile app (not recommended)
	- https://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2
		- Part 2:
			- Ionic Package or PhoneGap Build will compile and sign your apps in the cloud
			- Genymotion: 3000+ Android configurations to emulate & test
				- Uses Virtual Box
		- Part 3 - TypeScript & ES6:
			- ECMAScript 5 is the currently supported JavaScript version in all browsers
				- Possibly using at least ES6 (ES2015) now
					- adds classes, arrow functions, and module loaders
			** TypeScript is a superset of ES6 and adds the ability to declare variables as a specific type
				- typed:
					var index: number;
					index = 'a string'
						- error
				- classes:
					THE TYPESCRIPT:
						class User {
							name: string;

							constructor(name: string){
								this.name = name
							}

							sayHello(){
								console.log('Hello, I am', this.name);
							}
						}
						var user = new User('Ashteya');
						user.sayHello();
					TYPESCRIPT COMPILED INTO ES5
						var User = (function () {
							function User(name) {
								this.name = name;
							}
							User.prototype.sayHello = function () {
								console.log('Hello, I am', this.name);
							};
							return User;
						})();
						var user = new User('Ashteya');
						user.sayHello();
				- Arrow Functions:
					- new, shorter syntax for writing anonymous functions
					ES5 Code:
						function updateTime() {
							var _this = this;
							var time = new Date();
							setInterval(function (){ return _this.time = new Date(); }, 1000)
						}
					ARROW FUNCTION:
						function updateTime() {
							var time = new Date();
							setInterval(() => this.time = new Date(), 1000)
						}
				- javascript looks disgusting
		- Part 4 - Angular 2
			- open-source framework for building (web) applications
			- takes care of navigation, data binding, dependency injection, and much more
			- http://angular.io -> 5 minute QuickStart & Tutorial
			- Components:
				- implements a view or part of a view (displaying and managing)
				import (Component) from 'angular2/core';

				@Component({
					selector: 'current-time';
					template: <h1>Time: {{time}}</h1>
				})
				export class CurentTime {
					time: Date;

					constructor() {
						this.time = new Date();
						setInterval(() => this.time = new Date(), 1000);
					}
				}
			- Decorators:
				-new concept in TypeScript (and ES7/ES2016) for adding functionality to a class
				- @Component decorator is implemented within the Angular 2 framework.
					- takes care of coupling the class to a view template, data binding, dependency injection, etc.
				- selector is set to current-time, so:
					<body>
						<current-time>Loading...</current-time>
					</body>
			- Data Binding:
				{{time}} = time property from the CurrentTime object
					- every time time changed, the <h1> gets updated
					- from property -> view
				- can do view -> property for input
			- Modules:
				import {component} from 'angular2/core';
				- TypeScript compiler should loof for the angular2/core script in the project and import the Component module from it
					- automatically loaded
				- Modules are supported by TypeScript and ES6 and can be used with CommonJS, AMD, and other existing module systems
				- tsconfig.json = where can configure module options for the TypeScript compiler
				export class CurentTime { ...
					- export means can be imported as a module in other script files
		- Part 5 - Create an Ionic 2 App
			ionic start ionic2-tutorial-github blank --v2
				--v2 = ionic 2 project
				- jk, the v1 & v2 flags have been removed
				- now the default is ionic-angular and the other option is ionic1
			- Files & Folders:
				1) src = code (pages and services)
				2) hooks = scripts that can be executed as part of the Cordova build process
				3) node_modules = all modules, ionic uses npm to import modules
					- blank file has 21,890 items for 164.4 MB
				4) resources = icon & splash images for mobile platforms
				5) plugins = Cordova plugins
				6) www = code generated by the build scripts out of the app code
				7) config.xml = configuration for Cordova when creating app packages
				8) ionic.config.json = configuration for ionic CLI
				9) package.json = list of all used npm packages
				10) tsconfig.json = configuration for the TypeScript compiler
				11) tslint.json = TSLint checks TypeScript code for errors
				12) src/pages/home
					- home.html = template for the home page
					- home .scss = styles for the home page
					- home.ts = TypeScript for the home page
			*** BUILDING THE APP ***
			1) create a service to get the data from the GitHub API and inject it into the HomePage component
				- create a services folder in src and add github.ts with the following code;
					- the ionic CLI can now generate services (providers) with ionic generate
						ionic generate provider github.ts
					"
					import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
					import { Http } from '@angular/http';
					import 'rxjs/add/operator/map';

					@Injectable()
					export class GitHubProvider {
					  constructor(private http: Http) {
					  }

					  getRepos(username) {
					    let repos = this.http.get('https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos');
					    return repos;
					  }
					}
					"
					- @Injectable decorator lets Angular know the service can be injected into another module and we need Http to call the GitHub API
					- Http uses RxJS to return Observables
				- Your app.module.ts should look like this in Ionic 3.X
					"...
					import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';
					...
					imports: [
					  BrowserModule,
					  HttpModule,
					  IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)
					],
					"
				- import the github injectable in src/pages/home/home.ts
					1) import GitHubProvider:
						import {GitHubProvider} from '../../providers/github-ts/github-ts';
					2) create array of injectable providers to the component (only one for now):
						providers: [GitHubProvider]
					3) add two public properties to HomePage
						public foundRepos;
						public username;
					4) add github to the constructor:
						constructor (public github: GitHubProvider){}
					5) Create getRepos fn
						"
						getRepos() {
						  	this.github.getRepos(this.username).subscribe(
						  		data => {
						  			this.foundRepos = data.json();
						  		},
						  		err => console.log(err),
	  							() => console.log('getRepos completed')
						  	);
						}"
						- on an observable use the subscribe method with 3 functions/methods
							a) handle data
							b) error
							c) completed w/o error
				- Define the HTML template:
					- a bunch of <ion- UI elements
					- data binding for bind input to username & invoke getRepos()
					- *ngFor binding to loop through foundRepos

Summary:
	- Researched & Installed Ionic
Thoughts:
	- Hopefully we don't have to upgrade the Slack account for more third party, external, incoming webhook, integrations
	- Not being able to build iOS apps on Ubuntu makes me hate all the sheep for droning into that proprietary, designed for age 3+ bullshit
	- Installing everything needed to run my first ionic app on an Android Studio emulated phone was ridiculous and beyond difficult
	- Those last two thoughts somewhat contradict each other
	- I had to install wayyyyy to many dependencies and stuff. Hot damn I hope the future of software development doesn't have to be like this
		- To create a blank template you need internet and it takes up 213MB with 23,986 items...
		- Installing programs to manage packages
		- Rerouting paths to things in bashrc
		- Not being able to make iOS apps becuase I don't have a mac
		- I miss C/make/gcc :'(


1) Integrating Slack
	- Introduction: https://api.slack.com/docs/messages
	- Incoming Webhooks: https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks
	- Reached Integration Limit: https://ainc.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks
	- Pricing: https://ainc.slack.com/pricing
		- Says the free version should give 10 third-party or custom integrations
2) Ionic
	- http://ionicframework.com/docs/v1/guide/installation.html
		- "you must have OS X in order to develop and deploy iPhone apps, so OS X is recommended if possible."


Installing Ionic
	1) Install Oracle JDK 8
		sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
		sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default
	2) Install node.js: https://www.godaddy.com/help/install-nodejs-ubuntu-17395
		sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install nodejs
		sudo apt-get install npm
	3) Install Android Studio and the Android SDK (I doubt I need this for iOS Apps. Actually, IDT I can even make iOS apps with Ubuntu.)
		- download the exe
		- run studio.sh from android-studio/bin
			- https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html
			- installs Android SDK
		- Install dependencies: sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 lib32z1 libbz2-1.0:i386
	4) Install Ionic CLI & Related Tools:
		sudo apt-get install git ruby
		sudo gem install compass
		sudo npm install -g cordova ionic grunt-cli bower gulp
	5) Add the Android SDK to your PATH and set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable correctly. Using ~/.bash_profile for this is the usual approach.
		nano ~/.bashrc
		- at the top of the file add the lines:
			#AndroidSDK Path
			export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk
			export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
	6) Start using Ionic
		ionic start todo example
			- /usr/bin/env: ‘node’: No such file or directory
