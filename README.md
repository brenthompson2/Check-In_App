# Ionic App Development

This is where I am detailing my experience as I attempt to make mobile applications with the Ionic Framework

Status 09/01/17:
	- Created an app where the user can search for a github account and it shows all of the repositories they have
	- About to do more to the github app and also possible create an interface for the mobile application I am developing for Awesome Inc
