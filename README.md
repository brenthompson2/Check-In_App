# Ionic App Development

This is where I am detailing my experience as I attempt to make mobile applications with the Ionic Framework

Current Status 09/01/17:

	- Projects:
		- Developed a mobile application that gets a GitHub username from the user and displays all of the corresponding repositories. Upon clicking on a repository it brings the user to the appropriate README
			- followed this tutorial: https://gonehybrid.com/build-your-first-mobile-app-with-ionic-2-angular-2
		- Started working on the Awesome Inc Check-In App
			- It has been a process but it is starting to come along nice and legit-ly
			- It is still in desperate need of graphic design and Sass work
	- Ionic:
		- Annoyed with the difficulty I am having trying to learn as a result of the amount of abstraction
		- What all am I even using?
			- Ionic (3?), Angular 2, Node.js,
			- TypeScript, JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5), HTML, CSS, Sass (SCSS), JSON, PHP?,
			- Hybrid Mobile App Development, Reactive Programming, Asynchronous Data,
